// javascript engine - computer that executes JS code. eg - V8 engine
// contains Call stacks and heap
// call stack where our code is executed(execution context)
// heap is where our objects are stored (objects in memory)


// differnce b/w compilation and interpretation

/** compilation
 * entire code converted into machine code at once , and written
 * to a binary file that can be executed by computer.
 * 
 * 
 */

/***Interpretation
 * it runs through the source code and executes it line by line
 */ 

// just in time compilation - entire code is converted into machine
// code at once, then executed immediately
